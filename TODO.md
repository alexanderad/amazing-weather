So here is a list of features that _Amazing Weather_ requires to become even more awesome!

[x] related weather info: humidity, wind, temp range, etc  
[x] info about current location selected  
[ ] automatic location detection + notification about location change  
[ ] about window with reference to datasource API (credit according to usage rules)  
[ ] icon (ask Olesya to draw one)  
[x] automatic timer fire after wake up (lid close / lid open)  
[x] automatic timer fire after internet connection is established  
[ ] proper connection errors handling (fair timer reschedule algo?)  
[ ] allow to change precision of temp display in tray in settings  
[ ] ability to select between different datasources
